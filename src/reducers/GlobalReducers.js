                <h3>Importer of Record</h3>
                <p><strong>For online orders,</strong> we use a global shipping partner, BorderFree, and are pleased to offer our world-className merchandise to more than 100 countries.</p>
                <p><strong>For call-in orders only:</strong> The recipient is the importer of record and is responsible for complying with all laws and regulations for the Canadian destination. When our customer places an order with NeimanMarcus.com via phone, they authorize our customs broker to act as their agent with Canada Border Service Agency to clear merchandise and process all applicable duties, fees, and taxes.</p>
                <h3>Shipping Charges</h3>
                <p>Shipping is the charge for catalog and internet order processing, item selection, packaging, processing, transport, and handling. Special shipping requests, including specification of carrier and/or future shipping dates, may include additional charges. Shipping times are not guaranteed, notwithstanding additional charges, but are our best approximation and will vary with specific requests, such as gift packaging and monogramming.&nbsp; Shipments and deliveries occur only on weekdays. Shipping is subject to change and will be determined at time of order and subject to the following:</p>
                <h3>Standard Shipping</h3>
                <p>Unless Priority is requested, your order should arrive in approximately 3 to 5 business days after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST). Fish &amp; Wildlife items require additional time to ship.</p>
                <h3>Priority Shipping</h3>
                <p>If requested, add $10.00 to standard shipping. Your order should arrive in approximately 2 to 3 business days after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST) and may vary depending upon the destination. Please note International Priority orders placed after 12:00 noon (CST) Friday or on Saturday will be processed Monday and should arrive in 2 to 3 business days after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST) and may vary depending upon the destination. Some heavy or bulky items may not qualify for this service. A signature may be required and additional charges may be assessed if more than one attempt is made for delivery. This service is not available for some postal codes. Fish &amp; Wildlife items require additional time to ship.</p>
                <p>Certain items considered hazardous materials including aerosols and alcohol-based products (e.g., pressurized spray cans, hairspray, nail polish remover, etc.) are restricted to ground-only transport, due to air transportation restrictions and regulations.</p>
                <p className="updated">Last Updated January 22, 2015</p>
                <h3>Additional Address</h3>
                <p>Please add $8.00 to the applicable shipping charges for each additional shipping address.</p>
                <h3>Other Information Regarding Your Order</h3>
                <p>Items ordered together may be delivered separately, and the shipping will be allocated over shipments but not necessarily evenly. Some orders may require more than one package to ship; for these shipments the additional charge for Priority and Standard would be a per package charge.<br />Certain items considered hazardous materials including aerosols and alcohol-based products (e.g., pressurized spray cans, hairspray, nail polish remover, etc.) are restricted to ground-only transport, due to air transportation restrictions and regulations.<br />Returns may affect final shipping charges. Shipping charges are not refundable unless merchandise is damaged or defective. Returns for reasons due to Neiman Marcus will receive shipping credit as shipping was allocated, which may result in a final shipping charge after return that differs from quoted rates.<br />If you request to change the destination address of a shipment en route, an additional charge may be assessed.<br />NeimanMarcus.com is not responsible for refunding the gift packaging charge if Canada Border Services Agency deems it is necessary to open the package.</p>

Our policy is to ship these items ground to Canadian locations for an additional fee of $10.00.<br />Some items require Fish &amp; Wildlife declaration documents to export to Canada.
