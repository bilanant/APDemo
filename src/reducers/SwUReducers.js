                <h4>States Where Neiman Marcus Does Not Collect Sales or Use Tax</h4>

                <h5>Belt Measuring Instructions</h5>
                <p>To find out what size belt you wear, simply follow these guidelines:</p>
                <ol class="list-indent">
                    <li>First, decide whether you will be wearing the belt at your waist or on your hips (lower rise). This will affect the fit of the belt.</li>
                    <li>For waist belts, measure around your natural waistline (just at the belly button). This is usually the smallest part of your torso.</li>
                    <li>For hip belts, measure around the fuller part of your hips (not the fullest), where your low-rise jeans would fall. Note: Hip belts are carried in larger sizes so they can be worn on the hips.</li>
                    <li>The measurement that you get is your belt size (in inches or centimeters). Note: See our size guide above for inch and centimeter equivalencies.</li>
                    <li>The size of a belt indicates the measurement from the buckle prong (or other method of closure) to the middle hole of the belt.</li>

                <p>Before beginning, read the guidelines below and then compare your measurements to the charts above. For the best fit, wear little or no clothing while measuring, and use a fabric tape measure.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Bust:</strong> Wrap the tape around the fullest part of your bust, then drop your arms to your sides to measure.
			      </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Waist:</strong> Measure around your natural waistline, keeping the tape comfortably loose.
			      </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hips:</strong> Stand with your heels together, and measure around the fullest part of your hips.

                <p>Before beginning, read the guidelines below and then compare your measurements to the charts above. For the best fit, wear little or no clothing while measuring, and use a fabric tape measure. </p>

                <ul class="list-indent">
                    <li><strong>Neck:</strong> Measure around the middle of neck (at the Adam's apple). Allow room for your index finger to fit between the tape and your neck for a comfortable fit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chest:</strong> Wrap the tape around the highest part of your chest and shoulder blades, then drop your arms to your sides to measure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleeve:</strong> Bend arm and place on hip. Measure along the arm from the center back of your neck to your wrist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glove:</strong> Measure around the dominant hand starting at the knuckles, omitting the thumb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waist:</strong> Measure around your natural waistline, keeping the tape comfortably loose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inseam:</strong> Measure along the inside of the leg just below the crotch to one inch below the ankle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Kids' Size Guides</h3>
                <p>Sizing varies greatly between designers. If you are familiar with a designer, please order the size you normally do. If not, please match your measurements (in inches) to the size guides below.</p>

                <p>Tips from our Design Team on how to measure for curtains.</p>
                <h4>About Our Curtains</h4>
                <ul class="list-indent">
                    <li>Width refers to a single curtain panel, even when they are sold in pairs.</li>
                    <li>Rod-pocket curtain length is the distance from the top of the rod pocket to the bottom of the hem. It does not include top ruffles or other decorative treatments above the pocket.</li>
                    <li>Tie-top and tab-top curtain lengths are the distance from the top of the panel to the bottom of the hem. It does not include the ties or tabs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How Wide?</h4>
                <ul class="list-indent">
                    <li>Measure the width of the window, including any architectural molding or trim (if you want those to be covered by the curtains).</li>
                    <li>For a relaxed but tailored look with curtains loosely gathered, multiply the window width by 1.5 or 2. Divide that number by the width of a single curtain panel to get the number of panels you need.</li>
                    <li>For a full, luxurious look with curtains tightly gathered, multiply window width by 2.5 or 3. Divide that number by the width of a single curtain planel to get the number of panels you need.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How Long?</h4>
                <ul class="list-indent">
                    <li>For a traditional look, mount the curtain rod 4" above the top of the window. The distance from 4" above the window to about 1/2" above the floor is the length of your curtains.</li>
                    <li>For a grand, glamorous look with curtains that "puddle" on the floor, measure from 4" above the window to the floor, then add 3" to 4".</li>
                    <li>To make the room look taller, mount the curtain rod 2" to 3" below the ceiling. The longer curtains will draw the eye upward and create the illusion of a more spacious room.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Rods &amp; Finials</h4>
                <ul class="list-indent">
                    <li>The length of the curtain rod should equal the total fabric width.</li>
                    <li>Add the length of two finials to the rod length to get the total amount of space necessary.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>The remaining balance of your order, if any, will need to be charged to a credit card which can be entered on the payment screen.</li>
                    <li>Any unused value remains on the NM Gift Card<sup>®</sup> or NM Virtual Gift Card until you choose to use it.</li>

                <h3>Federal Requirements</h3>
                <p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law now requires Neiman Marcus and other retailers to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies customers in connection with certain gift card transactions. Such information includes your name, address, date of birth, and other identifying information, such as your driver's license or passport number.
         </p>
                <p>Neiman Marcus understands how important it is to our customers that such information is kept confidential. We will not use or transfer your information for any purpose other than as permitted or required by law, except with your consent.
         </p>
                <p>The new law also restricts our ability to offer gift card cash redemptions (other than minimal amounts required by law). In addition, certain returns may need to be processed at the Store Credit Office.
         </p>
                <p>We appreciate your cooperation with these new requirements. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact credit customer service at 1.800.685.6695.
         </p>

                <h4 tabindex="0" id="Replenishment-Manage">How Do I Manage My Replenishment?</h4>

                <h4 tabindex="0" id="Replenishment-Shipment">How Will I Know When To Expect A Replenishment Shipment?</h4>
                <p>Upcoming shipments and their dates are listed on the Replenishment Service page in your Online Account section. You will also receive an email 5-7 days prior to a shipment to confirm the shipping date and price of the item(s) you will be receiving. At that time, you can verify all information and/or make changes, if necessary.</p>

                <p>Yes. Once your first item in a Replenishment Service plan has shipped, you can make changes to future shipments. Just visit the Replenishment Service page in your Online Account section and click on the shipment you wish to change.

                <p>Yes. Once your first Replenishment Service item has shipped, you can make changes to future shipments.

For any item shown, you will find links to change the ship-to address for your next shipment(s) and to edit your billing information. Be sure to specify if you want the new information to apply to all replenishment items. Orders that have already shipped will appear in your Order History and cannot be changed.</p>
                <h4 tabindex="0" id="Replenishment-Cancel">Can I Cancel My Replenishment?</h4>
                <p>Yes. Just visit the Replenishment Service page in your Online Account section and click on the item you wish to cancel. Each item has a link to cancel Replenishment Service. Orders that have already shipped will appear in your Order History and cannot be changed.</p>
